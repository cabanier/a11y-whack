This is a slide deck and accompanying demo of a simple game developed in HTML5 canvas.  It was designed to be accessible and equally challenging for everyone, regardless of ability.  It supports game play by keyboard only users, screen reader users and screen magnification users.

The game uses two experimental features designed to make canvas more accessible.  Hit Regions and drawFocusIfNeeded() were added to the W3C spec in May of 2014 and are currently *only* implemented in Firefox Nightly 31.0a1+ (2014-04-26) with experimental flags canvas.focusrings.enabled and canvas.hitregions.enabled set to true.

This slide deck was presented at the Boston Accessibility Conference on 10 MAY 2014.
